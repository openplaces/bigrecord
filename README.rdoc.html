        <h1>Big Record</h1>
<p>
A Ruby Object/Data Mapper for distributed column-oriented data stores
(inspired by BigTable) such as HBase. Intended to work as a drop-in for
Rails applications.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic schemas (due to the schema-less design of BigTable).

</li>
<li>Support for column-oriented data stores.

</li>
<li>Similar usage to Active Record.

</li>
<li>Embedded records that store within a single table row.

</li>
<li>Automatic versioning.

</li>
<li>Scalability (depending on the data store used).

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Motivations</h2>
<p>
BigTable, and by extension, Bigrecord isn&#8217;t right for everyone. A
great introductory article discussing this topic can be found at
http://blog.rapleaf.com/dev/?p=26 explaining why you would or
wouldn&#8217;t use BigTable. The rule of thumb, however, is that if your
data model is simple or can fit into a standard RDBMS, then you probably
don&#8217;t need it.
</p>
<p>
Beyond this though, there are two basic motivations that almost immediately
demand a BigTable model database:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Your data is highly dynamic in nature and would not fit in a schema bound
model, or you cannot define a schema ahead of time.

</li>
<li>You know that your database will grow to tens or hundreds of gigabytes, and
can&#8217;t afford big iron servers. Instead, you&#8217;d like to scale
horizontally across many commodity servers.

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Big Record: Ruby Object/Data Mapper. Inspired and architected similarly to
Active Record.

</li>
<li>Big Record Driver: JRuby application that bridges Ruby and Java (through
JRuby&#8217;s Drb protocol) to interact with Java-based data stores and
their native APIs. Required for HBase and Cassandra. This application can
be run from a separate server than your Rails application.

<ul>
<li>JRuby 1.1.6+ is needed to run Big Record Driver.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any other requirements needed to run Hadoop, HBase or your data store of
choice.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optional Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Big Index (highly recommended): Due to the nature of Big Table data stores,
some limitations occur while using Big Record standalone when compared to
Active Record. Some major limitations include the inability to query for
data other than with the row ID, indexing, searching, and dynamic finders
(find_by_attribute_name). Since these data access patterns are vital for
most Rails applications to function, Big Index was created to address these
issues, and bring the feature set more up to par with Active Record. Please
refer to the <tt>Big Index</tt> package for more information and its
requirements.
